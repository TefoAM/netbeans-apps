Some examples of what I've done using Netbeans and Java language.

clone the files into your machine, ensure that you have java downloaded using the following link:

My favourite one is the tic tac toe app. it's in my home language, Sesotho. i felt pretty good about it when i was done.

just click run and enjoy!
